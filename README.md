This application is the weather dashboard. 
WHEN I search for a city, I can see that city's current weather conditions as well as the 5 day forecast. The city is added to the search history. WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city I can see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.
WHEN I click on a city in the search history, the current weather shows as well as the 5 day forecast. 
I used a weather API for this application. I made 2 calls: first call was for the current condition, and the second one was for the forecast. I used the fetch method to call the API. 
I also used a Dayjs to display current date and format the forecast days. 
I used form element and preventDefault for it.
